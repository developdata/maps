Visualising Data on Maps
==============

The project contains the files needed for the workshop on visualising data on maps. It will be updated through next week.

It contains the relevant javascript libraries as well as the earthquake data from USGS.

It can be cloned to an online editor such as [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) if you do not want to host it on your machine.
